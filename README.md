# Logics4's CommonClasses, for Java Projects

This project is supposed to hold a bunch of classes I might routinely use in some of my projects because they come in handy. They might be useful for you too. You decide.</br>

## Well, I'm interested!
Nice!</br>
I decided it was better to organize them in Maven modules, so that one can choose to use only what they need, without having to compile everything else. They are basically little standalone subprojects inside this big one called CommonClasses.</br>
As such, check each module's folder to know more about the one you want, how to use it and its license (different modules might have different licenses).</br>
All these modules run on Java 8 environments.
